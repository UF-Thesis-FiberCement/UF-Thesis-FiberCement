# Fiber Cement Cladding Intimately Attached to Wood Structural Panels in Moist or Marine Climates: Analyzing the Extent of Risk

## Abstract

It has been common practice to install fiber cement panels and trim in direct, intimate contact against water resistive barriers. This may present localized points of failure in the longevity or durability of the building envelope when wood-based sheathings are used.
